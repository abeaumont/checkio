CheckIO Solutions
=================

**SPOILER**: There you will find solutions for `CheckIO <http://checkio.org>`_
Python programming game.

Solutions are compact. This means that they may be unreadable, use tricky
syntax, use short names and lack documentation. It does not represent good
coding practices. However, they are not the shortest possible solutions, since
they:

* follow `PEP8 style guide <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
  conventions.
* do not alter calling code (assertions), except for fulfilling previous
  requirement
* do not duplicate code
* work with both Python 2 and 3
